Title: Thank you very much!

I try to do it in a chronological order, what doesn't need to be exact how I have since 2004 almost no time feeling anymore. So it is very possible that I mixed events in time, or timing up, and I'm sure nobody will feel offended by that. :)

Thank you [XmrStreet](https://x.com/xmrstreet), for supporting me from the beginning and this, my second [CCS proposal](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/vThorOfflineSigningLibrary_XmrSignerToProduction.html) and for being the reason I landed in the Monero Community, what was his call, that somebody should take over the funded MoneroSigner proposal on X, what lead to make the first bounty I burned my fingers on, the second I freaked out and stopped it (the one everoddandeven is finishing now and I abandoned/postponed the second time...), and went then on with the [MoneroSigner Resurrection CCS](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/%20MoneroSignerResurrection.html). What was a complete nightmare and the best thing what happened to me for a long time - at the same time.
XmrStreet helped me also to bootstrap with the [XmrSigner](https://github.com/XmrSigner/) (still in re-branding), and helped me in so many ways!

[Plowsof](https://plowsof.github.io/) was and is always there, literally always. You wonder when this guy sleeps :D and how he can digest all my testaments (info drops like autistic people call it, probably very annoying to read my messages always in debug mode, almost trace mode). He is always helping with his insights and picking you up from the floor, when you about to end up there, because of external influences in your life. I think that a lot of people don't appreciate him that much he deserves and forget about that apart of being moderator and helping hand for a lot of stuff - he is also a human being with his own thoughts, opinions and emotions. I'm happy that plowsof motivated me various times to not give up, like on this proposal. Thank you plowsof!

The next I remember (well I cheated a bit here in looking the chat logs up) is support I experienced from [SyntheticBird](https://github.com/SyntheticBird45), [r4v3r23](matrix:u/r4ver23:monero.social)(which gave me the first indicators to UR and polyseed and [ANONERO (onion)](http://anonero5wmhraxqsvzq2ncgptq6gq45qoto6fnkfwughfl4gbt44swad.onion/) helped me a lot during development), [j0j0](matrix:u/j0j0xmr:monero.social) and [Rottenwheel](https://www.rottenwheel.com/) (which supported me all the way and spread also awareness with [revuo](https://www.revuo-xmr.com/)) from the beginning of the journey on the first community meeting. And [hinto](matrix:u/hinto:monero.social), [ct](matrix:u/ct:xmr.mx), [rucknium](https://rucknium.me/) in the second meeting, and [Py.Verse](https://repo.getmonero.org/PyVerse47), [un traceable](https://twitter.com/@donttracemebruh), [Daniel](https://repo.getmonero.org/Daniel618-art).

Also I want to thank [luigi1111](https://github.com/luigi1111) for his works in the "shadow" (or should I say better backend) and when it is really urgent to get paid for the milestone not letting you down. Then there is [tobtoht](https://github.com/tobtoht), helping me with difficulties cross compiling monero-wallet-rpc, not only by giving advise but putting some hours of work into it, beside giving advise and helping me for the current CCS and getting more clarity, taking himself so much time to help me, and I always surprised what he is all doing and get's done, thank you very much!

Thank you [jeffro256](https://github.com/jeffro256/) for explaining me some pitfalls, [kayabaNerve](https://x.com/kayabaNerve), for taking the time for reading and responding my testaments, and for supporting me on the last proposal: [geonic](https://repo.getmonero.org/geonic)(sorry, couldn't find a better link), [sneurlax](https://github.com/sneurlax), [monerobull](https://x.com/monerobull) [SNeedlewoods](https://github.com/SNeedlewoods) (for the support and the patience), also the "drive by" support from the [47 people](https://x.com/XmrSigner/status/1847557103419789518) liking my proposal on X. Thank you [rbunner7](https://github.com/rbrunner7) for convincing me on my closed and postponed proposal, that my scope is too huge for 3 months, and for the text and support written on [r/Monero](https://old.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/1ggnapm/donate_and_help_xmrsigner_reach_production/?) and the participation and thoughts for [XmrSigner](https://github.com/XmrSigner/xmrsigner/discussions). Thank you [ofrnxmr](https://github.com/nahuhh/) for providing a subdomain ([onion sneak preview](http://nuloxt7g5kyavotgekjkcpb5jwnogre4jjw5n32675rgd4umqjm3csad.onion)) and coolify deployment for the documentation which I hope on the end of the CCS get merged into monero docs after a PR for the lib happened. Thank you [Diego](https://github.com/rehrar) for you help and time! 

And also a thank you for all current and future [donors contributing](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/vThorOfflineSigningLibrary_XmrSignerToProduction.html) which make everything possible!

Hopefully one they I can give back each of you more then I happily received,
and wish you all an happy, successful and amazing time,
